**I have submitted all the weeks' exercises into this repository.**

If you want to access the exercises for a particular week, use ```git log``` to find the **hash** of the **commit_label** for a particular week's exercises. You'll find a list of **commit_labels** below.

Then use ```git checkout {hash}```, where ```{hash}``` is the **hash** of the commit, to change the application contents to a particular commit.
